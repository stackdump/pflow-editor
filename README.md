### Motiviation

Petri-Nets allow for formal validation of many aspects of an algorithm.

This tool supplies a GUI tool for creating and simulating Petri-Net Designs.

### Why use Petri-Nets?

[Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) & [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) techniques can be embraced more formally by using Petri-Nets as an executable specification for business rules and process design.

Petri-Nets are very well explored structures that serve as excellent tools for modeling distribued systems.

Petri-Nets can be coded to run in any programming language with deterministic results and predictable behavior.

Datasets designed with Petri-Nets are easy to vectorize, making generated data sets attractive targets for ETL pipelines.
